				NativeGap is an ongoing research project that I began as an undergraduate. Following our
				success and feedback with <a href="CloudTwin.html">Cloud Twin</a>, Mohammed Davoodi and
				I wanted work on a system to leverage PhoneGap's utilities for cross-platform
				compilation. However, we still felt the need to preserve the native look and feel of an
				application written for a given platform versus one written as a web application. Our
				initial trials proved fruitful, but since Mohammed graduated, this project has not yet
				been completely realized. We believe that utilizing Aspect Oriented Programming and
				some fancy Javascript, we can develop a prototype capable of capturing a wide body of
				html components and translating them to their native counterparts, thus easing the
				developer burden in creating multi-platform apps and retaining the aesthetics of
				natively written applications. This work is being performed under the direction of my
				research advisor, <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/">Dr. Eli Tilevich</a>.

						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>
						The modern mobile software marketplace is characterized by a multiplicity
						of platforms, including Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone. HTML5 and
						Javascript frameworks, such as PhoneGap, make it possible to engineer and
						maintain multiplatform mobile applications [1] [2]. Unfortunately, such
						applications lack the native look and feel users prefer of those written for
						a particular platform [3]. To address this issue, this research puts forward
						a novel approach that executes PhoneGap JavaScript mobile applications
						natively on the Android platform. Specifically, the native execution utilizes
						existing PhoneGap functionality to replay events and reflect the changes in
						the Android GUI in real time. Our initial case studies with third-party
						applications indicate that the presented approach can become a viable
						solution to the heterogeneity of the mobile application market.
