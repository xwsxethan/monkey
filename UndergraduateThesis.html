						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>
						To successfully compete in the software marketplace, modern mobile applications must run
						on multiple competing platforms, such as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Companies
						producing mobile applications spend substantial amounts of time, effort, and money to port
						applications across platforms. Creating individual program versions for different platforms
						further exacerbates the maintenance burden. This thesis presents Cloud Twin, a novel
						approach to natively executing the functionality of a mobile application written for another
						platform. The functionality is accessed by means of dynamic cross-platform replay, in which
						the source applicationâ€™s execution in the cloud is mimicked natively on the target platform.
						The reference implementation of Cloud Twin natively emulates the behavior of Android
						applications on a Windows Phone. Specifically, Cloud Twin transmits, via web sockets, the
						UI actions performed on the Windows Phone to the cloud server, which then mimics the
						received actions on the Android emulator. The UI updates on the emulator are efficiently
						captured by means of Aspect Oriented Programming and sent back to be replayed on the
						Windows Phone. Our case studies with third-party applications indicate that the Cloud
						Twin approach can become a viable solution to the heterogeneity of the mobile application
						market.
