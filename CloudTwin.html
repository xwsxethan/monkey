				Cloud Twin was my very first research project as an undergraduate. I began working on it in
				Spring of 2013 along with Mohammed Davoodi. Eeshan Shah had been working on the project for
				some time, but was graduating that May so Mohammed and I were to take over after Eeshan left.
				The three of us worked under <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/">Dr. Eli Tilevich
				</a> to formulate a way to dynamically replay gui events from one platform (Android) onto
				another (Windows Phone). What we were able to create became known as Cloud Twin.

						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>
						To successfully compete in the software marketplace, modern mobile applications must run on
						multiple competing platforms, such as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Companies producing
						mobile applications spend substantial amounts of time, effort, and money to port
						applications across platforms. Creating individual program versions for different platforms
						further exacerbates the maintenance burden. This paper presents Cloud Twin, a novel approach
						to natively executing the functionality of a mobile application written for another platform.
						The functionality is accessed by means of dynamic cross-platform replay, in which the source
						application's execution in the cloud is mimicked natively on the target platform. The
						reference implementation of Cloud Twin natively emulates the behavior of Android applications
						on a Windows Phone. Specifically, Cloud Twin transmits, via web sockets, the UI actions
						performed on the Windows Phone to the cloud server, which then mimics the received actions on
						the Android emulator. The UI updates on the emulator are efficiently captured by means of
						Aspect Oriented Programming and sent back to be replayed on the Windows Phone. Our case
						studies with third-party applications indicate that the Cloud Twin approach can become a
						viable solution to the heterogeneity of the mobile application market.
