Website Code

This is a public repository for a website I'm building (slowly) to act as profile page for me.

The plan is to make use of JQuery and Angular.js to make a nice, bootstrap so things look at least a little fancy. Those parts are all necessary for a minimum viable product (not that this will ever be sold to anyone, but for my own standards).

Stretch goals include utilizing Backbone.js instead of Angular or even with it if possible, just as a reason to learn that technology. If I have time and patience, I may even add in D3 for some graph visualizations. Finally, I would like to at some point connect the page to some of my public endpoints such github, linkedin, facebook, soundcloud, flickr, etc. The last part is not so hard to do, but more difficult to make it presentable as well as clean up my online presence.
