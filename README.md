Website Code

This is a public repository for a website I'm building (slowly)
to act as profile page for me.

The plan is to make use of JQuery and Angular.js to make a nice,
fluid interface for my own home page. I'll also utilize some
bootstrap so things look at least a little fancy. Those parts
are all necessary for a minimum viable product (not that this
will ever be sold to anyone, but for my own standards).

Stretch goals include utilizing Backbone.js instead of Angular
or even with it if possible, just as a reason to learn that
technology. If I have time and patience, I may even add in D3
for some graph visualizations. Finally, I would like to at
some point connect the page to some of my public endpoints
such github, linkedin, facebook, soundcloud, flickr, etc. The
last part is not so hard to do, but more difficult to make it
presentable as well as clean up my online presence.
