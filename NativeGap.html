				NativeGap is an ongoing research project that I began as an undergraduate. Following our 
				success and feedback with <a href="CloudTwin.html">Cloud Twin</a>, Mohammed Davoodi and
				I wanted work on a system to 
				leverage PhoneGap's utilities for cross-platform compilation. However, we still felt the
				need to preserve the native look and feel of an application written for a given platform
				versus one written as a web application. Our initial trials proved fruitful, but since
				Mohammed graduated, this project has not yet been completely realized. We believe that
				utilizing Aspect Oriented Programming and some fancy Javascript, we can develop a 
				prototype capable of capturing a wide body of html components and translating them to
				their native counterparts, thus easing the developer burden in creating multi-platform 
				apps and retaining the aesthetics of natively written applications. This work is being
				performed under the direction of my research advisor, Dr. Eli Tilevich.

						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>
						The modern mobile software marketplace is characterized by a multiplicity
						of platforms, including Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone. HTML5 and
						Javascript frameworks, such as PhoneGap, make it possible to engineer and
						maintain multiplatform mobile applications [1] [2]. Unfortunately, such
						applications lack the native look and feel users prefer of those written for
						a particular platform [3]. To address this issue, this research puts forward
						a novel approach that executes PhoneGap JavaScript mobile applications
						natively on the Android platform. Specifically, the native execution utilizes
						existing PhoneGap functionality to replay events and reflect the changes in
						the Android GUI in real time. Our initial case studies with third-party
						applications indicate that the presented approach can become a viable
						solution to the heterogeneity of the mobile application market.
